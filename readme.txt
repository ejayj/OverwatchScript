Development notes Tuesday, February 6th 2024:

The script.py, and teams.json scripts are part I of this project. These will be loaded into my Django project (or possibly flask project for ease. Initially set to django, but we may use django for the spotify project instead).

The javascript notes folder holds the transcriptionof script.py into script.js; this has been transferred over to htdocs/OverwatchJS folder to get a simple version of this project off the ground and styled.
